*California Beach Finder allows a user to enter a city name and locate beaches near them.  The user can create a Login and add beaches to their list of favorites.  They can also save and update reviews of particular beaches.  There is a data visualization page for the app that allows a user to see the percentage of all beaches in a pie chart that represent the following attributes: Stroller-Friendly, Restrooms, Camping, Fishing, Dog-Friendly and Bike-friendly.
Used 3 external APIs including one managed by Coastal California Commission, Google React Maps and Google Geocode to fetch data for beach locations based on a userâ€™s preferred city and parse them against a dataset of 1500 beaches to retrieve and add markers for the nearest beaches within 11 miles of the city center according to google maps.
Implemented Rails API for the backend.  The app Used React for the Front End, implemented full C.R.U.D. for beach reviews and favorite beaches*
